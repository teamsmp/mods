# teamsmp/mods

This is the Team SMP++ modpack, [available on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/teamsmp++), that is based on [Performium by KasaiSora](https://modrinth.com/modpack/performium-was-taken) as of version 5. It contains many mods that can be used on the Team SMP - JunglTemple uses this pack himself, probably because he made it. It's weird speaking in third person about yourself.

## DISCLAIMER

This modpack contains mods that are allowed on the Team SMP, but may be blacklisted on other servers! Use at your own risk.
